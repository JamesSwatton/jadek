Hello

I'm Jade, from Portsmouth, based in London. 

I like drawing, painting, and self-publishing **zines** and **comics**. Favourite subjects: food, under the sea, cryptozoology, aliens, body horror.

Always keen to talk collaborations or opportunities.

I've also worked as an **editor** in the arts for over a decade, and can also **proofread** and **copy edit** your stuff.Â Email me to enquire about my budget-friendly rates.

Get in touch at jadeaudreyking\[@\]gmail.com

Thanks and goodbye
