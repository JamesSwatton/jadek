Hello

I'm Jade, based in the UK. I like drawing, painting, and self-publishing zines and comics. Favourite subjects: food, under the sea, cryptozoology, aliens, body horror.

I've worked as an editor in the arts for over a decade, and can also proofread and copy edit your stuff. 

Always keen to talk collaborations or opportunities.

Thanks and goodbye
