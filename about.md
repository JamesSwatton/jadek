Hello

I'm Jade, from Portsmouth, based in London.

I like drawing, painting, and self-publishing **zines** and **comics**. Favourite subjects: food, nature, under the sea, cryptozoology, body horror.

Always keen to talk collaborations or opportunities.

I've also worked as an **editor** in the arts for over a decade and can **proofread** and **copy edit** your stuff.Â Email to enquire about my budget-friendly rates.

Get in touch at jadeaudreyking\[@\]gmail.com

Thanks and goodbye
