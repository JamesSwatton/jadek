Elephants are once ‘exotic and familiar’ (Haywood 2012): they can be trained to give rides, perform and interact with people closely due to their mental capabilities. Originally London Zoo housed their elephants in a ‘whimsical’ cottage (Pastscape 2007), and much later, in 1939, elephants were kept in Lubetkin’s relatively tiny Gorilla House. Before the practice was stopped in the early 1960s, elephants were exercised through giving rides to visitors. Gleeson (1933: 44) believed that ‘[a]n unreliable elephant is a most unproductive investment for any Zoological society’.

A new home was built as part of 1958’s ‘New Zoo’ redevelopment plan (Pastscape 2007). The Elephant & Rhino Pavilion, or Casson Pavilion, ‘seemed to attempt to create an idea or abstraction of “nature” without resembling anything that could actually be seen in nature’ (Rothfels 2002: 200): its most distinctive design feature being the green copper silos which rise ‘like a clump of pachyderms with their heads together’ (Miller 2002). The rough concrete coating of the building resembles an elephant’s skin, and is tough enough to ‘prevent the animals from damaging the fabric’ (Guillery 1993: 43).
