Berthold Lubetkin and his architecture firm Tecton were commissioned to design a pool for London Zoo’s penguins in 1934. Their earlier commission resulted in a white, circular Gorilla House. Modernist design was a move toward a ‘biotechnic age’ (Mumford in Gruffudd 2000: 223), yet Gruffudd notes (2000: 222) that these buildings were the result of new ideas about nature and ‘experiments in harmonizing living creatures and their designed spaces’ through rational scientific enquiry (Anderson 1998: 46). The penguin commission gave Lubetkin chance to showcase modernist design to the masses: he saw architecture as ‘a statement of the social aims of the age’ to help man ‘understand, to explain and to control his surroundings’ (Coe & Reading 1981: 17). Lubetkin undoubtedly considered the needs of the animals in the design process (Coe & Reading 1981: 36), yet in a way philosophically distinct from his predecessors: he rejected the naturalistic approach as ‘tokenism’ (Gruffudd 2000: 225). For Lubetkin, naturalistic design ‘allowed the very shy animals to hide themselves from the public gaze … while those with a taste for publicity were not able to indulge it’ (Allan 1992: 200). The zoo was a theatre: an appropriate building would showcase the penguins’ pure ‘penguinness’.

Zoogoers enjoyed leaning over the parapets to look down upon the ‘little dinner-jacketed friends’ (Glancey 2004) plodding up and down the ramps (British Pathé 1939), and the Pool was critically well received (Coe & Reading 1981: 36). Its circular form, like an egg, meant the walls acted ‘as a sounding board for the penguins’ calls’ (Guillery 1993: 84). It also had a variety of floor surfaces to stimulate the birds (Gruffudd 2000: 229), and a diving pool. The nearby ailanthus tree was incorporated in Lubetkin’s plans as ‘a natural foil to his geometric abstraction’, and for practical reasons too: fallen twigs and leaves provided the penguins with nesting material (Allan 2002: 69). I was interested to see old photographs where the young tree had not yet needed to be accommodated by a cut-out section (Avanti Architects [no date]). The penguins ‘bred successfully’ (Allan 1992: 209), which was believed to indicate a successful zoo building (Hediger 1964: 37).
